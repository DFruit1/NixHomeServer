# NixHomeServer – Agent Guidelines

## Purpose

This repository defines a reproducible NixOS home-server focused on:

* Identity & SSO (Kanidm, OAuth2 Proxy)
* Self-hosted apps (Immich, Paperless, Audiobookshelf, Filestash)
* Edge routing (Caddy, Cloudflared, Netbird, Unbound)

---

## Git Tracking

* Ensure all new git files (except for those in .gitignore) are tracked as soon as they are created to avoid visibility issues during nix rebuilds
* Avoid tracking huge files and directories that do not need to be tracked, such as build directories or caches
* Do not track plaintext secrets or other sensitive information

---

## Rebuild Command

* Prefer the guarded deploy helper for rebuild. 
* Rebuilds including nix drv and rust build artifacts should be done on the remote server when possible.
* The deployed bootstrap sudo password is stored as the root-only agenix
secret `serverBootstrapSudoPassword`, which materializes at
`/run/agenix/serverBootstrapSudoPassword` on the server. If an interactive sudo
prompt is unavoidable, refer to that secret rather than relying on memory.

---

## Module Structure
* Modules are individual applications and their configuration. The repo should be designed in such a way that removal of a module does not break any functionality whatsoever 
* Core_Modules are always assumed to exist in the config and aren't normally modified or removed. Therefore, other modules and config can always assume these modules will exist.
* Impermanence should always be centrally defined within core modules to prevent accidental data deletion on module removal. Module data should be persisted unless explicitly removed within the central impermanence module.
